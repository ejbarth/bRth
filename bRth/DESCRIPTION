Title: Some Base R Functions Modified for Uniform Input Argument Structure 
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Eric", "Barth", email = "ejbarth@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: bRth provides a collection of wrappers for base R functions
    for summary statistics (mean, sd, table, median, fivenum, etc)
    that have been modified to employ a uniform input argument calling strategy, 
    including data=<dataframe> and the ability
    to input a formula var1~var2 in places that the base functions 
    accept only pairs of variables (cor, table).  The motivation is to extend the
	similarities in calling the plot() and lm() functions, together with the
	na.rm formalism from mean(), to other commonly-used summary statistics functions. 
	The naming convention in bRth is <function_name>K:
	meanK(), sdK(), corK(), etc
