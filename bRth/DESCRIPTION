Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Eric", "Barth", email = "ejbarth@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: bRth provides a collection of base R commands
    for summary statistics (mean, sd, table, median, fivenum, etc)
    that have been modified to employ a uniform input argument calling strategy, 
	including data=<dataframe> and the ability
    to input a formula var1~var2 in places that the base commands 
	accept only pairs of variables (cor, table).
